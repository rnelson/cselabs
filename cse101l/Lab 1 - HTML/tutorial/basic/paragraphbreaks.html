			<h2>Paragraph Breaks</h2>

<p>
  In the <a href="../introduction/index.html">Introduction</a>, we covered some
  basic HTML concepts. Now we're ready to start learning some HTML
  tags by working with a concrete example.

<h3>A Favorite Quotes Page</h3>

<p>Let's say we want to make a website that lists some TV and movie
quotes.</p>

My Buffy Quotes

Angel: "Dear Buffy..." Hmmm. I'm still trying to 
       decide the best way to send my regards.
Spike: Why don't you rip her lungs out? That might 
       make an impression.
Angel: Lacks... poetry.
Spike: Doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?

Cordelia: You're really campaigning for bitch of 
          the year, aren't you?
Buffy: As defending champion, you nervous?

Principal Snyder: It's woolly-headed liberal thinking 
                  like that that gets you eaten.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  Now, this is a perfectly acceptable web page. The
  <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags are
  all in the right places. In fact, this example is just like the "Simple Web Page"
  from the <a href="../introduction/divingin.html">Diving In</a> section, 
  except that the text is a little different.
</p>

<p>
  There is one small problem, however. As we saw in the 
  <a href="../introduction/tinkering.html">Tinkering</a>
  section, <em>HTML collapses whitespace</em>. This means that all
  our text will collapse into a single paragraph and look like this:

<p>Try this yourself -- copy and paste the HTML from the 
<b>Unformatted Text</b> example into a file and view the file 
on your own computer.</p>

<h3>The &lt;p&gt; Tag</h3>

<p>The results are terrible -- not what
we want at all. Let's try to make this page more readable.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag breaks text into paragraphs. Any
text that you surround with a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and a closing
<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> becomes a separate block. Let's see how
this works.  For brevity, we will start to leave off the structural
tags: <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and 
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

                    like that that gets you eaten.
&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We've surrounded all the major blocks of text with
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>aragraph tags. What do the results look like?
(Try it.)</p>

That might make an impression. Angel: Lacks... poetry. Spike:
Doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?</p>

<p>Cordelia: You're really campaigning for bitch of the year,
aren't you? Buffy: As defending champion, you nervous?</p>

<p>Principal Snyder: It's woolly-headed liberal thinking like that

</div>

<p>
  Each block is followed by two line breaks. This is a good start!
</p>

<h4>A Digression:  Correct &lt;p&gt; Tag Usage</h4>
<p>
  Notice that each paragraph is surrounded by an opening tag, 
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and a closing tag, <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
  That's because the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is a <em>block tag</em>; 
  it "does something" to a block of text. The browser needs to know when the
  block ends. Thus, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag needs a closing
  tag, <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This is a subtle point, but a substantial number of web designers take the 
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag to mean  "make a new paragraph here" or "put 
  two line breaks here", rather than "enclose this text and make it a 
  paragraph".
</p>

<div class="code">
<h4 class="inline">Incorrect &lt;p&gt; Tag Usage</h4> 
<pre>
Text Block 1:  Blah blah blah...
&lt;p&gt;
Text Block 2:  Blah blah blah...
&lt;p&gt;
Text Block 3:  Blah blah blah...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  What happens? (Try it.) Actually, this works just fine.  
  Text Block 2 and 3 are paragraphs (the
  browser "inserts" a closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag right
  before each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag). <strong>Text Block 1 is not
  actually a HTML paragraph.</strong> However, you get
  two line breaks between each text block, which is the same result as
  doing it the proper way. 
</p>

<p>
  The reason this trick works is because 
  browser vendors <em>know</em> that many people use the
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> incorrectly. So all major browsers actually
  display these broken web pages <em>as if the closing tag was
  actually there</em>. The browsers "guess" where the closing tag is
  supposed to go. So what's the big deal? Why not do it the "improper" 
  way? After all, you don't have to type all those <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>
  tags.
</p>
<p>
  The main <em>practical</em> reason is that you can use a method
  called "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) to control the appearance of all tags 
  of a particular type.  For example, you could set all your paragraphs 
  to be red 12pt Times New Roman throughout your entire site. 
  If you're in the habit of using the paragraph tag properly, your CSS will
  work just fine; if you're not, then some of your "paragraphs" will not
  display properly.  It's better to do it the right way from the start.
</p>

<h3>The &lt;br&gt; Tag</h3>

<p>
  We still need to break up the related lines of dialogue. Now, we
  <em>could</em> do this with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, but
  then all lines would be equally spaced. and so it wouldn't be clear
  that the exchanges between Angel and Spike or between Cordelia and
  Buffy belong together.  How do we get finer control... say, one line break?

  My Buffy Quotes
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Angel: "Dear Buffy..." Hmmm. I'm still trying to 
          decide the best way to send my regards.&lt;br&gt;
  Spike: Why don't you rip her lungs out? That might 
         make an impression.&lt;br&gt;
  Angel: Lacks... poetry.&lt;br&gt;
  Spike: Doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Cordelia: You're really campaigning for bitch of 
            the year, aren't you?&lt;br&gt;
  Buffy: As defending champion, you nervous?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Principal Snyder: It's woolly-headed liberal thinking 
                    like that that gets you eaten.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  Unlike the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, the
  <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag does not enclose any other HTML. There
  is no such thing as a closing <code>&lt;/br&gt;</code> tag.
  Also note that we don't have to put a final <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
  tag on the last line of each dialogue exchange. The
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag will take care of the last line break
  for us.
</p>
<p>
  So now we've separated each speaker with a new line. How does
  this look? (Try it.)

  Now each line of dialogue is on its own line on the page. The
