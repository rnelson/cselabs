<h4>The Red-Headed League</h4>
<p>
  I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
  autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very
  stout, florid-faced elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair.  With
  an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes
  pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
