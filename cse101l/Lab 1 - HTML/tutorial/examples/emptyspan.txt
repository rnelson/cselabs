<p>
  Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but 
  unconquering whale; <span>to the 
  last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab 
  at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at 
  thee.</span> Sink all coffins and all 
  hearses to one common pool! and since neither can 
  be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still 
  chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned 
  whale!  Thus, I give up the spear!
