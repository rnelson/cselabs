  My Buffy Quotes
</p>
<p>
  Angel: "Dear Buffy..." Hmmm. I'm still trying to 
          decide the best way to send my regards.<br>
  Spike: Why don't you rip her lungs out? That might 
         make an impression.<br>
  Angel: Lacks... poetry.<br>
  Spike: Doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cordelia: You're really campaigning for bitch of 
            the year, aren't you?<br>
  Buffy: As defending champion, you nervous?<br>
</p>
<p>
  Principal Snyder: It's woolly-headed liberal thinking 
                    like that that gets you eaten.
