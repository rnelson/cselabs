  <b>The Model XJ-2000:</b>
  Quality, quality, quality.  That's what our bosses 
  asked for when we designed the XJ-2000, and that's 
  what we delivered. Our competitors claim to deliver
  "quality"... but do they?  Sure, they prattle on about 
  about sample rates, picosecond/div sweep rates, 
  Fast Fourier Transforms, and other technical 
  mumbo-jumbo.But the fact is that the XJ-2000 is 
  light-years ahead of the competition.  From the 
  scratch-resistant chrome case to the innovative 
  green-phosophorescent screen, only one word should 
  spring to mind when you look at the XJ-2000: quality.
