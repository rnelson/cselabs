  Here's how the chorus goes:
</p>
<p>
  When Irish eyes are smiling,<br>
  Sure, 'tis like the morn in Spring.<br>
  In the lilt of Irish laughter<br>
  You can hear the angels sing.<br>
  When Irish hearts are happy,<br>
  All the world seems bright and gay.<br>
  And when Irish eyes are smiling,<br>
  Sure, they steal your heart away.<br>
