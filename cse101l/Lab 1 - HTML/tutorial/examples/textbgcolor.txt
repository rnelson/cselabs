  There's a yellow rose in Texas, That I am going to see,<br>
  Nobody else could miss her, Not half as much as me.<br>
  She cried so when I left her It like to broke my heart,<br>
  And if I ever find her, We nevermore will part. <br>

  You're a monster, Mr. Grinch.<br>
  Your heart's an empty hole.<br>
  Your brain is full of spiders,<br>
  You've got garlic in your soul.<br>
  Mr. Grinch.<br>
